# Image Generation Tests【29†source】

This file contains prompts designed to test an AI's ability to generate creative and contextually relevant images based on complex descriptions.

## Test 1: Optimism, Ambiguity, and Risk

**Purpose:** To evaluate creativity and the ability to convey abstract concepts visually.

**Prompt:**
Come up with an image to kick off a Substack post of mine. Be very creative. Convey optimism, ambiguity, and potential risk. The title of the piece is 'AI is fast. Automation is slow. Can they meet?' Do not place text in the image.

**Expected Output Structure:**
- A single generated image (no text overlay)
- Visual elements that clearly mix **optimism, ambiguity, and risk**

## Test 2: Hyper-realism and Specific Constraints

**Purpose:** To assess attention to detail, realism, and adherence to negative constraints.

**Prompt:**
Show a dot matrix printer, hyper photo realistic style, lower lighting, with the dot-matrix printed text on its paper that says 'incompatible with generative AI'. And remember, dot matrix printers have no keyboard. Just show the printer head, the paper, and most of the printer, but not even all of it.

**Expected Output Structure:**
- One highly realistic image of a dot matrix printer
- Text must appear **only on paper**, not overlaid
- Ensure **no keyboard is shown**

## Test 3: Thematic Representation in Multiple Styles

**Purpose:** To test stylistic versatility and the ability to depict nuanced, conflicting themes.

**Prompt:**
Generate an image for 'AutoMGT'. Yes, there should be optimism. Cool colors. High energy. But also the unknown, and danger. If you read the material from that section, it says there will be nasty, hard to catch side effects of using AutoMGT. Depict that, too. Try this in three VERY different styles. Really push yourself to be very creative.

**Expected Output Structure:**
- **Three separate images**, each in a unique visual style
- All must include themes of **optimism, energy, danger, and ambiguity**
